# Flutter Web â€” Trip List (Pixel-Perfect to Figma)

**A responsive Flutter Web screen that displays a list of trips â€” pixel-perfect to the provided Figma design.**  
Built with scalable clean architecture (Data / Domain / Presentation). Riverpod + MVVM friendly. Includes instructions to run locally and deploy to Firebase Hosting.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project implements a single responsive Flutter web screen that matches the provided Figma design exactly (colors, fonts, spacing, assets). It follows a scalable clean architecture split into three layers:

- **Data** â€” local data source (`assets/trips_mock.json`), models, and repositories.
- **Domain** â€” entities and use-cases (business rules).
- **Presentation** â€” UI, view models (MVVM), and state management.

State management is pluggable â€” Riverpod + MVVM is recommended (and implemented as an example). The repo uses an `app_exports.dart` barrel file to centralize common imports / theme / colors / utilities.
